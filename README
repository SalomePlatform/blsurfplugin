About SALOME MG-CADSurf plug-in
*******************************

SALOME MG-CADSurf plug-in adds DISTENE MG-CADSurf (former BLSURF) meshing algorithm
to the SALOME Mesh module.

MG-CADSurf meshing algorithm is destined for generation of 2D meshes basing
on the 2D geometric entities (faces).

--------------
Pre-requisites
--------------

SALOME platform relies on a set of third-party softwares; some of them are needed
at build time only, while other ones are needed in runtime also.

For more information about the pre-requisites please visit SALOME platform web
site:

* Check Release Notes and Software Requirements of the latest SALOME release at

  <http://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/current-version/>

* Pre-requisites page at SALOME web site:

  <http://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/license/>

Note: SALOME MG-CADSurf plug-in needs SALOME KERNEL, SALOME GUI, SALOME Geometry
and SALOME Mesh as pre-requisites.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

The build procedure of the SALOME platform is implemented with CMake.
In order to build the plug-in you have to do the following actions: 

1. Set up environment for pre-requisites (see "Pre-requisites" section above).

2. Create a build directory:

   % mkdir BLSURFPLUGIN_BUILD

3. Configure the build procedure:

   % cd BLSURFPLUGIN_BUILD
   % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_directory> <path_to_src_dir>

   where
   - <mode> is either Release or Debug (default: Release);
   - <installation_directory> is a destination folder to install SALOME MG-CADSurf
     plug-in (default: /usr); 
   - <path_to_src_dir> is a path to the SALOME MG-CADSurf plug-in sources directory.

   Note: by default (if CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option is not given), SALOME MG-CADSurf
   plug-in will be configured for installation to the /usr directory that requires
   root permissions to complete the installation.

4. Build and install:

   % make
   % make install

   This will install SALOME MG-CADSurf plug-in to the <installation_directory>
   specified to cmake command on the previous step.

-------------------
Custom installation
-------------------

SALOME MG-CADSurf plug-in supports a set of advanced configuration options;
for more details learn CMakeLists.txt file in the root source directory.

You can also use other options of cmake command to customize your installation.
Learn more about available options by typing

   % cmake --help

=====
Usage
=====

* Start SALOME.

* Create new study.

* Activate Geometry module and create simple geometry object.

* Activate Mesh module.

* Invoke menu "Mesh/Create Mesh".

* Select previously created geometry object by clicking it with the
  mouse in the Object Browser.

* In the "Create mesh" dialog box:
  - activate "2D" page;
  - In the "Algorithm" combo box select "MG-CADSurf";
  - Click on the button at the right of the "Hypothesis" combo box and
    select "MG-CADSurf parameters" item in the drop-down menu.

* In the "Hypothesis Construction" dialog box set parameters of MG-CADSurf
  meshing algorithm and click "OK" button

* In the "Create mesh" dialog box Click "Apply & Close" button to
  define mesh and close the dialog box

* In the Object Browser select "Mesh_1" object, invoke context popup
menu for it by clicking right mouse button and select "Compute" item

The resulting mesh created with MG-CADSurf plugin will be shown in the 3D
viewer.
